While I am doing this assignments, first, I have learned how to declare the derived type of structure.
 Also, I have learned how to declare an object of a structure type. And also I have learned how to 
initialize an object of a structure using curly braces. Since we made object of a structure as an array, 
we have to use two pairs of curly braces to initialize that. Also, I have learned how to access each 
members of an object of structure type. Furthermore, I feel like I have learned how to use flag more. 
Doing this assignment, I had three chances to use flag, and I felt like I am getting used to use flag 
which is good way to code.

Doing this assignment, if I used just parallel array, it would have been much harder. That is because 
when we make parallel array, the variables in the array have to be same data type. But when we 
make structure type, it does not have to be same data type. So I declared id, and age as an integer 
type, and salary as a double type in one structure. And after I declare the derived type, to declare 
the object of structure which makes me be able to access all the members, I just needed to write 
only one line which is more concise to code, and more efficient for memory as well. After that, I 
could access all the data regardless it is integer type or double type. So it was much efficient to 
make this program with this array of structure.

Actually, we can declare the structure (derived type) in a separate file. And it is called “header file”. 
If we declare the structure using header file, the advantage is we can use that structure as much as 
we want in different many other source code simply adding only one line, for example, #include 
“Student.h”. And when we want to modify that structure data, simply, only with editing the header 
file, the all source code which is connected with that header file will be affected so that it is much 
easier to manage the program.
