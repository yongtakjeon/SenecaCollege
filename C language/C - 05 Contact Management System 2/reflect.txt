While I am doing this assignment, I have refined the ‘contactHelpers.c’ source code adding some 
functions. Firstly, I refined ‘getTenDigitPhone’ function which gets the value of 10 Digit. It was really 
useful function when I prompt the user for phone number. Also, I made ‘findContactIndex’ function 
which I consider one of the key function of this assignment. It was really beneficial function. If there 
is matching phone number among the contacts, it returns the matching index number, or if there 
in not, it returns -1. Therefore, when I make addContact, updateContact, and deleteContact function, 
it was really useful to find empty spot, or find the matching data. Also, I made displayContact 
function, and when it comes to this function, the tricky part for me was I had to check if ‘middleInitial’ 
contains the value or not, so if it has value I had to display that value. So for that, first I put the 
condition, if (contact->name.middleInitial != '\0'), like this. But later I found just the 
‘middleInitial’ itself is address as it is array’s name, so I realize I have to access the first element of 
this array using ‘[0]’. So I could change the condition part like this, 
if (contact->name.middleInitial[0] != '\0'). I had to keep this thing in my mind when I make 
not only this function but also other functions as well. Lastly, I tried to make ‘sortContacts’ function 
reviewing the course notes on Algorithms. I have used ‘selection sort’ for this function, and when I 
use this algorithm and figure out how this works, it was interesting. Basically, in inner loop, it finds 
the smallest number, and in outer loop, the smallest number is put first element, and then second 
element, and third... Overall, doing this assignment, I feel like I am getting used to call and use the 
various functions within another function for efficiency.

As I mentioned before, I have considered the using ‘findContactIndex’ function as one of key point of 
this assignment. It was really useful function, and I feel like I can reuse this function when I make 
program later. When we deal with data put in the array, we can refine the data accessing each index 
number. And simply using this function, we can easily figure out which element will be refined. If 
we do not use this function, we will have to code looping every time to find the correct index 
number. Furthermore, ‘getTenDigitPhone’ was really good match with ‘findContactIndex’ function. 
To find the right index number using ‘findContactIndex’ function, we had to prompt the phone 
number. And ‘getTenDigitPhone’ function prompts and gets the value of 10-digit safely so that we 
could use ‘findContactIndex’ function properly. Also, this function was really useful when I get the 
phone, home, or business number safely as well.

Actually, I thought this week assignment will include ‘Text File’ part, and honestly, that made me 
nervous as it looks not that easy. However, I thought if save/load functionality would be included 
in this program, it would make our program much better because once we turn off the Visual Studio, 
the data which we have modified or created will be gone. But using save/load functionality, we 
could save our data safely, and load as well. Therefore, I thought save/load functionality is really 
needed to our program, and if our program includes save/load functionality, this could be crucial 
functionality of our program.
