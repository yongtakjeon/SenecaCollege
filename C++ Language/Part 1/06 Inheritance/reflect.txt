While I am doing workshop, I have learned concept of inheritance. Derived class inherits all member 
of Base class except for constructors, destructors, and the assignment operator. However, there 
would be a situation which derived class has a function with same identifier with the function which 
is contained in the base class. In that case, the function of derived class shadows the function of 
base class. Therefore, to call the function of base class which is shadowed by the function of derived 
class, we can use ‘scope resolution’ when we code implementation of the function of derived class.

Also, I had to pass the argument to the constructor of base class. In that situation, we have to 
receive the argument of base class’ constructor with the parameters of derived class’ constructor. 
Once we receive the all argument through derived class’ constructor, we can pass those arguments 
to the constructor of base class coding implementation of derived class’ constructor.

Furthermore, while I am doing milestone, I had to create the function which only returns integer 
value. Figuring out how to do that, I have learned the ‘!’ overloaded operator which returns true if 
‘cin’ has error flag, false if ‘cin’ has no error flag. Also, once cin is set up error flag, we have to clear 
the flag in order to make cin operate properly, so I had to use cin.clear() function for that. Moreover, 
when we store the value in the integer variable, if character value is entered, character value cannot 
be stored in the integer variable, and it will just remain in the input buffer. Therefore, I had to clear 
the input buffer otherwise the character value which remains in the input buffer keeps trying to be 
entered in the integer variable which causes an error. To clear the input buffer, I could use cin.ignore() 
function.
