While I am doing this assignment, I have learned how to create and use a function template. In the 
function template, we only define the algorithm, and when we use function template in the main 
function, complier will generate the real code of the function. When we create function template, 
we define the identifier in the parameter, and this identifier can be any other data type when we 
use function template in the main function which means it is a generic type so that it leads a code 
to make less redundancy.
