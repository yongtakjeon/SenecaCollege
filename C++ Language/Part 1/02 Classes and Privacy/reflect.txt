While I am doing this assignment, I have learned about the ‘class’. We would use ‘structure’ in C, 
but in C++, we use class instead of that. The difference is by default, structure has public value 
while class has private value which leads to be more secure. Since it has private value, we have to 
access those private values with the function which is declared in the public part of the class, so 
there are query functions, and setting the values functions, and setting safe empty state function, 
and display function and so on. When we code function’s definition in the implementation file, I 
had to code ‘Cargo::’, and ‘Train::’ to let complier know that where these functions are belong to so 
that these functions are able to access private variables in the class. Furthermore, I had to use 
‘cout.setf(ios::fixed)’ and ‘precision(2)’ to print only two decimal places of double type data. After I 
used this, I had to unset fixed format using ‘unsetf’, also had to use ‘precision(6)’ to change back 
to default.
