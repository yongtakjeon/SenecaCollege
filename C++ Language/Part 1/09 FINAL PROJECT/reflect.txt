It was a long journey to complete this project. While I am doing this assignment, first, I have learned 
about the modularity more. I had to create the seven different header file separately. It was the 
biggest module that I have ever created. Especially, using ‘Utils’ module is optional, so it was good 
experience to use ‘Utils’ module by myself whenever I felt I needed that.

Also, this project covers the three most prominent concepts of ‘object-oriented programming’ which 
are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. While I am building this project, I could learn 
concepts of each principles specifically. Encapsulation is kind of hiding data in the private section 
using class so that it can prevent the data from unauthorized access or unexpected change. 
Inheritance is the relationship between the classes, so derived class inherits all the data member 
from the base class. Lastly, polymorphism is based on the idea that same name could have many 
different meanings.

Furthermore, building this project, I guess the trickiest part for me was creating the code for 
receiving only integer value. For this, I had to use ‘!’ operator, clear(), ignore() methods which was 
new to me. If I use ‘!’ operator like this, “!cin”, it will check if cin object has error flag or not, so if it 
has, it returns true, so in my case, I could use this to check if user inputs integer value or not. After 
this, if the cin’s flag is set to error flag, I had to clear the flag state using cin.clear() method to 
prompt the user’s input properly again. Also, for clearing the input buffer, I used cin.ignore() method. 
It was interesting to learn how istream class works.

To conclude, it was really good experience to deal with all of those things, and finally create this 
program.
