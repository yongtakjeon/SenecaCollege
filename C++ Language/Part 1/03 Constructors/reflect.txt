While I am doing this assignment, I had chance to deal with setting the constructor and destructor. 
Constructor is a special member function which is executed at creation time of its class, and the 
destructor is also special member function which is executed right before the class is out of scope. 
Usually, constructor is divided into ‘default constructor’ and ‘overloaded constructor’. When there is 
no parameter, default constructor will be executed, and when there are parameters, the overloaded 
constructor will be executed. Basically, default constructor is used for setting safe empty state while 
overloaded constructor is used for setting the class’ member’s value with parameter sent. 
Furthermore, destructor is used for deallocating the dynamic memory, so if there is no allocated 
dynamic memory, there is no need to use destructor.

When we declare the member function, using ‘const’, we can prevent the values of the object’s 
member from changing. Therefore, if we will not change the values of member, it is always good to 
use ‘const’ such as when we use query functions. While I am doing this assignment, on the contrary, 
there was a situation which I had to remove ‘const’ because of its function. I had to change the 
value of ‘m_power’ in the ‘fight’ function, but since there was a ‘const’, I could not change its value, 
so that I had to remove ‘const’. Also, to change the value of ‘other.m_power’, I had to remove the 
'const' which was in the parameter.
