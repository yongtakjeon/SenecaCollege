This week, we have learned algorithm. I felt it definitely would be useful tool. While doing this 
workshop, I had many chances to deal with algorithms. One of things I have used algorithms was 
accumulate(). Since I had to display total play time for the collection, accumulate() was useful tool 
was for that. Also, I have used sort() function. Before, I had to code bubble code or selection code, 
but thanks to sort(), I did not need to code those kind of things. Also, I have used any_of() to check 
if there is a song by artist that is given. Furthermore, I used copy_if() to make a list of song by artist 
given.

I felt like these algorithms were really useful. Compared to using manual loops, the code looks more 
straightforward, and it made me much easier to manage the container. I would definitely use these 
algorithms later on as well.

Lastly, sort() function which I made receives the value between ¡°title¡±, ¡°album¡±, or ¡°length¡± through 
parameter. However, there would be a case which user send the wrong argument. To deal with that 
kind of situation, we could check if the value received by parameter is not one of three, or the value 
is nullptr, or its first element is \0. In those kind of cases, we could throw exception to handle the 
error.
