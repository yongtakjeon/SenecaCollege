This week, we have learned about function, especially about function object and lambda expression. 
Basically, lambda expression is pretty much same with function object. Lambda expression is 
unnamed function object which is able to capture variables in scope, but it is shorthand for function 
object, so depends on the situation, it could be more efficient than function object to use.

Moreover, we have learned way of error handling as well. To handle the error, we could use try, 
catch, throw keyword. While I am doing this workshop, I had a chance to use those keywords. When 
I code overloaded constructor of SpellChecker class, I had to use throw keyword for the case the 
file could not be read properly, so I throw a string for the exception. If I didn¡¯t use throw keyword, I 
could just print out some error message to the console, but using try, catch, throw makes code looks 
more straightforward, so I would use error handling method for this kind of cases.

Also, in the workshop, Movie and Book class have pretty much same logic. Therefore, it would have 
been more efficient to use template for these classes creating template class so that it could prevent 
our code from being duplicated.

Furthermore, I had to make custom constructor for both Movie and Book classes. When we make 
overloaded constructor, default constructor has to be defined. That is because if we only define 
overloaded constructor without defining default constructor, when we try to make object without 
sending any argument, it will throw an error, so it would be good practice to define default 
constructor when we use custom constructor.
