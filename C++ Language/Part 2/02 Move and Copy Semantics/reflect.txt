This week, we have learned about move semantics. We have learned about copy semantics last 
semester, but there is a weakness about copy semantics. Since it does deep copy, if it has 
to copy a large amount of data, it takes much more time than shallow copy, so if the object is not 
used anymore after copied, using move semantics would be much more efficient as move semantics 
do shallow copy. However, the problem about shallow copy is it could generate the run-time error 
since it could release the memory which is allocated dynamically twice in the destructor. That is why 
we have to assign ¡®nullptr¡¯ to already copied pointer variable like below code:

bunchOfStrings = src.bunchOfStrings;
src.bunchOfStrings = nullptr;


Furthermore, while doing this workshop, we had chance do deal with measuring the time using 
chrono library. It was the first time I have ever seen this, so it was a bit confused at first, but soon I found
it is interesting and it could be useful when we need to measure the time.
