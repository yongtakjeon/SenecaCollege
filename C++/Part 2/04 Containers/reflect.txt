This week, we have learned about composition, aggregation and association. Basically, these are the 
relationship between classes. Before, we have learned about ¡®inheritance¡¯, and these three are less-
coupled which is weaker relationship than inheritance. Basically, composition is the strongest 
relationship of the three, and the difference between composition and aggregation is responsibility 
of copying and destroying its resource. While composition is responsible for copying and destroying 
its resource, aggregation is not, but still the common thing of two is these two have ¡®has a¡¯ 
relationship to other class while association does not have ¡®has a¡¯ relationship, and it is weakest 
relationship of the three.

Since in composition, one class completely owns another class, when one class is created, another 
class also has to be created. Also, when one class is destructed, another class also has to be 
destructed, so the class that owns another class has to define another class¡¯ creation and destruction 
in the constructor and destructor. On the other hand, in aggregation relationship, two classes¡¯ 
creation and destruction is completely independent. It is just one class could add another class in 
it, or could delete it, or even if there is no another class in it, it is totally okay since those classes 
are independent.
