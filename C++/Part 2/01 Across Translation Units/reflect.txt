This week, we have learned about 'static' and 'extern' keyword. The keyword ¡®static¡¯ makes the 
variable private to only that file whereas keyword ¡®extern¡¯ brings a variable from another translation 
unit which refers to external linkage. While I am doing this workshop, I had to declare a global 
variable named ¡®g_sysClock¡¯, and had to use that in main.cpp file, so I have used ¡®extern¡¯ keyword 
for that.

Also, we have learned about ¡®argc¡¯, and ¡®argv¡¯ which refer to ¡®argument count¡¯, and ¡®argument vector¡¯ 
respectively. The number of arguments passed to the program is stored in ¡®argc¡¯, and each argument 
passed to the program is stored in ¡®argv¡¯. The thing that we have to notice is first element of ¡®argv¡¯ 
points to the program name not the argument passed.

Furthermore, I had to use a local-to-function variable to count the number of the function called. 
For that, I have used ¡®static¡¯ keyword to make the variable remain in memory for the lifetime of the 
program.

In part 2, I had to make the code improved to store the string of ANY length, so that I have used 
dynamic memory allocation. Moreover, to prevent the code from generating an error, I had to 
override the copy constructor and copy assignment operator as well.
