While I am doing this assignment, I have learned about shallow copy and deep copy. Furthermore, 
I have learned how to define the copy constructor and copy assignment operator. Basically, compiler 
will perform both even though we do not define them. However, it will be shallow copy. Therefore, 
we could make the custom definition of a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator by 
ourselves to make deep copy. Codes of copy constructor and copy assignment operator are pretty 
much similar. The difference is since copy assignment operator would be executed after the variable 
has been created, we have to check if there is an already allocated dynamic memory, and if so, we 
have to deallocate it. Moreover, we also have to check if it is a self-assignment.

Furthermore, I have learned how to overload extraction and insertion operators associating our own 
classes with the iostream classes. Basically, the role of extraction operator is similar with display() 
function, and the role of insertion operator would be similar with set() function. First, since we 
cannot modify the iostream classes directly, these overloaded operators are supposed to be defined 
globally. Also, the reason why the return types of overloaded operators are modifiable reference to 
the stream object is to enable them cascading.
